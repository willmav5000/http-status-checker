# HTTP Status Checker #

This script allows you to scrape an entire domain for links and check the HTTP status of each one to see if they are dead or alive. It's coded in PHP and uses MySQL, jQuery and some Javascript. And allows you to export the list to a spreadsheet.

This script is useful for those who work in web design, SEO, etc.

If you or your use the script please feel free to display some credits :D.
